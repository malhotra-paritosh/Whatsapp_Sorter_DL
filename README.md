# Deep Learning Whatsapp Sorter 

A project that uses Deep Learning to classify images from a phone's Whatsapp Images folder into classes, so that they can be managed easily.

Core of the DL model is a pre-trained VGG-16 model, on top of which I put custom output layers for the use case.

The eventual aim is to minify the models and serve it as a mobile application of reasonable size.
